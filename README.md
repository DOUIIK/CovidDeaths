# CovidDeaths Project

This project is divided into two steps
- The first phase is focused on sql where we connect our Covid dataset to the Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, and then we explore our data using different queries.  
- The second phase involves setting up queries to create multiple visualisations and building our dashboard in 'Tableau'.
